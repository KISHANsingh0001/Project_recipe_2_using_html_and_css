                    <h2>Recipe</h2>
                    <h2>Prepare the Sugar Syrup (Gulab):</h2>
                    <ol class="RecipeBox">
                       <li>In a saucepan, combine sugar and water.</li>
                       <li>Bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.</li>
                       <li>Add cardamom powder and rose water to the syrup and let it simmer for 5-6 minutes until it slightly thickens.
                       </br> Then, turn off the heat.
                         Keep the syrup warm while you make the Gulab Jamun balls.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Prepare the Gulab Jamun balls:</h2>
                    <ol class="RecipeBox">
                     <li>In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and baking soda.</li>
                     <li>If using saffron strands, crush them and add to the mixture.</li>
                     <li>Add ghee and mix well. The mixture should resemble bread crumbs.</li>
                     <li>Slowly add milk little by little, and knead the mixture into a soft, smooth, and slightly sticky dough.
                     </br>Add milk cautiously,
                         as you might not need the entire amount mentioned in the ingredients list.
                     </li>
                     <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for 5-10 minutes.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Shape the Gulab Jamun balls:</h2>
                    <ol class="RecipeBox">
                     <li>Divide the dough into small, smooth balls without any cracks. Make sure they are compact and smooth. If the dough feels too sticky,
                         grease your palms with ghee while shaping the balls.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Fry the Gulab Jamun balls:</h2>
                    <ol class="RecipeBox">
                     <li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan or skillet over low-medium heat. 
                        The oil/ghee should be moderately hot, not too hot, or too cool.</li>
                     <li>Fry the Gulab Jamun balls in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Fry until they turn golden brown, stirring 
                        gently for even cooking. This may take around 5-7 minutes per batch.</li>
                     <li>Remove the fried Gulab Jamun balls using a 
                        slotted spoon and drain excess oil by placing them on a paper towel.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Soak the Gulab Jamun:</h2>
                    <ol class="RecipeBox">
                     <li>While the Gulab Jamun balls are still warm, gently drop them into the warm sugar 
                        syrup (Gulab). Ensure the syrup covers the Gulab Jamun entirely.</li>
                     <li>Let the Gulab Jamun soak in the syrup for at least 1 to 2 hours before serving. During this time, the Gulab
                         Jamun will absorb the syrup and become soft, juicy, and flavorful.</li>

                   <ol>
                      <li><h3>Making Rasgulla (Cottage Cheese Dumplings):</h3>
                        <ul>
                           <li>In a large pot, bring 1 liter of milk to a boil. 
                               Once  it starts boiling, add the lemon juice or  <br> 
                               white vinegar gradually while stirring gently.</li>

                           <li>The milk will curdle, and the whey will separate  
                               from  the solids (curdled milk). Turn off the heat.</li>

                           <li>Line a strainer with a cheesecloth or muslin cloth  
                              and  pour the curdled milk through it to separate the  <br>
                               whey from the cottage cheese. Rinse the cottage cheese  <br>
                                under cold water to remove any lemony flavor.</li>

                           <li> Squeeze out the excess water from the cottage cheese by   
                               gathering the cloth and pressing gently. Hang the cloth for   <br>
                                about 30 minutes to drain
                                the remaining water.</li>
                           <li> After 30 minutes, remove the cottage cheese from the cloth and knead  <br>
                              it well until it becomes smooth and   forms a dough-like consistency.</li>
                           <li>Divide the cottage cheese into small equal-sized  balls and press them   <br>
                              gently to flatten slightly.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><h3>Cooking Rasgulla:</h3>
                        <ul>
                           <li> In a wide pan, combine 4 cups of water and 1 cup of sugar. Bring it to a boil,
                               ensuring the sugar dissolves completely.</li>
                           <li> Carefully drop the cottage cheese balls into the boiling sugar syrup.</li>
                           <li>Cover the pan with a lid and let the Rasgullas cook on medium heat for about
                               15-20 minutes. They will puff up during the cooking process.</li>
                           <li> Once the Rasgullas are cooked, they will float to the surface. Turn off the 
                              heat and let them cool for a few minutes.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><h3>Preparing Flavored Milk (Ras):</h3>
                        <ul>
                           <li>In another saucepan, heat 1 liter of milk. Stir it occasionally
                               to avoid burning or sticking to the bottom.</li>
                           <li>Add sugar, cardamom powder, and saffron strands to the milk. Mix 
                              well and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes until it reduces slightly and thickens.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><h3>Soaking the Rasgullas:</h3>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Gently squeeze the syrup from the cooked Rasgullas.</li>
                           <li> Transfer the Rasgullas to the prepared flavored milk (Ras).
                               Allow them to soak for at least 2 hours in the milk to absorb the flavors.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><h3>Serving Rasmalai:</h3>
                        <ul>
                           <li> Garnish the Rasmalai with chopped pistachios or almonds.</li>
                           <li> Serve chilled for the best taste and experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
